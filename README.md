APS360 Tuberculosis Classification Project:

Project aims to build a model able to identify Tuberculosis. This will first and foremost be via classifying paitents as Healthy, Sick without TB, have active TB, have latent TB, and have uncertain TB.

As a strech goal we seek to have our model identify where in the X-ray TB is present such that our model may be used more easily as an assistive diagnostic tool for healthcare professionals.
